      <h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>We love <strong> adventure!</strong> <br>
        Our Purpose here at Dry Oar is to share that same excitement to all the couples out there! <br>
        We want all couples, <strong> young</strong>, or even a <strong>little older</strong>, to take some needed relax to enjoy this beautiful place with us.
     </p>
      <p>
        As opposed as our competitors, here at Dry Oar there's <strong>No</strong> need to bring anything with them, but the <strong>desire to learn</strong>, if they are new to the sport, or wish to <strong>spend a great time</strong> to fill out their memory book with their loved one. <br>
        We will provide all the equipment needed, fun and entretaiment for a great well spend day! <br>
        We also have the <strong>best </strong>teachers, and staff here at Dry Oar. We want to make sure they get the main idea of why they need to choose Dry Oar over other Rafting places, using a great and attractive design in our website.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Couples</p>
      <p>
        I would focus on <strong>any type of couples</strong>, ranging in between their 20's to their 40's, since it's a high risk sport. <br>
        But woudn't be limited to that range of age sice we will offer certain sections of the river for beginners.
        We will focus on <strong>couple packages</strong>, whose desire is to spend some quality time with the person they love the most.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why couples? </em><br>
        Rafting is a team work sport, so we would like to encourage couples to work together in order to <strong>overcome </strong>any rough water they could be facing.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would like to have an easy access website, easy to check on a smartphone. Most of the couples are busy with work, family, and other stuff, so they won't always have time to sit down and plan a getaway on a desktop.
      </p>

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      <p>Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/db573d-d9dbba-dd7c27-f7c44f-1b344f" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c</a></p>

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Lilita One  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
       So far, I have chosen Lilita One for my headings. Since it is going to be used for the most visible text on the website I wanted it to have some style, and a good kearning.
        I want to foucus on couples, so I want to include both genders. I think this font is relax, inspired on the outdoor activity and unisex,so it can attract both genders.
         <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Gochi Hand  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        It was easier for me to chose Gochi Hand for the paragraphs of my website than the one for the headings.
        I tried to use the same context, I wanted a font to be relax and unisex.
        But also wanted one that could be readable, plus it could actually look diferent, if I decide to add font or cursive if needed in the text.<!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.  Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters.  No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you.

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or child pages.
      </p>  
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.
      </p>
      <!--
Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page boxes… Some suggestions are below:

• FAQ
• Blog
• Contact Us
• Rivers We Run
• Schedule/Rates/Dates -->

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages.  They should show the major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative locations of each element.  In the wireframe below you can see there will be 6 sections to our page:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain means an image) and the navigation bar.</li>
        <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the screen.</li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image </li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3  social media icons. </li>

      </ol>
